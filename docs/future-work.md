# Future Work

The first iteration of Providence goes a long way to gaining insights from session replay data. There are areas we plan to improve in the future: 

-Build and test a version that generates two summaries per session: one broad, detail-rich version for the knowledge base, and a second, shorter, event-focused version for the dashboard display.

-Build the agent code to allow Providence to work with multi-page applications, as it is just for single-page applications now.

-Integrate more traditional session replay features, such as console logs and a summary of network requests, into the dashboard to provide metrics that augment the session replay summary.

-Enhance Chatbot - Currently, the chatbot does not do a good job of answering questions about specific metrics. There are tactics to improve this that we would like to explore and implement.

Future enhancements aim to expand the number of sessions that can be included while keeping the interface simple and easy to navigate.
