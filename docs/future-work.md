# Future Work: Expanding Features and Capabilities

Providence allows you to gain insights from session replay data without watching the replays. Our team at Providence has identified the bullet points below as possible areas for improvement.
* Build and test a version that generates two summaries per session: one broad, detail-rich version for the knowledge base, and a second, shorter, event-focused version for the dashboard display.
* Build the agent code to allow Providence to work with multi-page applications, as it is just for single-page applications now.
* Integrate more traditional session replay features, such as console logs and a summary of network requests, into the dashboard to provide metrics that augment the session replay summary.
* Enhance the chatbot: The chatbot excels at providing general insights about user behavior but does a poor job of answering questions about precise metrics. For example, ask it “How many sessions were recorded yesterday?” and it could return an error, a hallucinated number, or the correct answer. There are tactics to improve this. 
* Improve the user interface for multi-session summaries and expand the number of sessions that can be selected at one time.
